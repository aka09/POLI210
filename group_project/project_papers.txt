- DV: "regime cycles," defined as regular changes in regime characteristics that are not *toward* a particular ideal-point (democracy or autocracy)
- IV: a "lame-duck syndrome" induced by an anticipated end to the incumbent's grip on power

1. Be more explicit about the research design and why it's appropriate

Allison 1969

1. Allison sets up his study as a "failed most-likely case": "A crisis decision, by a small group of men in the context of ultimate threat, this is a case of the rational policy model par excellent."
- Do we agree with that? Or do we think was this a difficult case for rational choice models to explain? 
- e.g. the tight deadlines made "rational" thinking more difficult
- the magnitude of the problem necessarily implied that many organizations/individuals had motivations to get involved

2. Is the rational choice model "good enough"?
- We know that it makes unrealistic assumptions and simplifies to a great degree; but that's the role of a theory!
- How much do we gain by complexifying our theories? Is it worth the loss in parsimony? 

3. The diagnostic: is the rational choice model to be thrown out, or should its scope conditions simply be more clearly defined?
