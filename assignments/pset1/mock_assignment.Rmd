```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# Question 1 

```{r}
setwd("~/Grad/McGill Fall 2021/POLI210/assignments/pset1")
```

Do NOT use the `View()` function when knitting. For RStudio Cloud users: you do not need to set the working directory and you must "import" the dataset into the cloud. 

# Question 2

```{r}
# place whatever code you need here
```

The dataset contains whatever number of observations and whatever number of columns
