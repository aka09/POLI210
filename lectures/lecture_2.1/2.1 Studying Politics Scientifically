## Plan for today

- What makes science scientific? 
- What is social science for?

## Political science as a science

Political science: the scientific study of politics \pause

What does it mean to study something "scientifically"? \pause

- Very contentious -- what science is and what science should be is an ever-evolving debate \pause
- e.g. we may disagree that political science is a science! \pause 

Definition by negation: Michael Moore

## Discussing "Bowling for Columbine" 

How scientific is Michael Moore's method? \pause

The good: 
- Longitudinal comparison in the US \pause
- Cross-national comparisons \pause
- Attempt to keep certain factors "constant" \pause

The bad: 
- No systematic data on keeping doors unlocked \pause
- Relative vs absolute gun violence \pause 
- Does not engage with prior work \pause 

## Principles of scientific research

Some principles (keep in mind these are contested) \pause 

- Empiricism: knowledge is derived from real-world observation \pause 
- Method: There are rules (more or less loose) for processing those real-world observations \pause 
- Objectivity: observation and interpretation is independent of the researcher's biases \pause
- Accumulation of knowledge: a community builds on one another's findings \pause
  
## Principles of scientific research

You may wonder whether this is achieveable in the social sciences \pause

There are a lot of complications...

- We disagree on the best way to measure a concept \pause
- We disagree on the proper method of analyzing data \pause
- Our biases can get in the way of our analysis...\pause
- And our biases almost certainly affects our choice of RQs! \pause
- Findings can be contradictory; the "body" of literature not coherent

## The scientific process

1. Familiarize yourself with the literature
2. Come up with a research question
3. Clarify the core concepts
4. Develop a theory
5. Derive hypotheses 
6. Find a suitable way to test hypotheses
7. Gather empirical evidence 
8. Analyze evidence  
9. Communicate the results

Each of these steps is an art of itself! 

## A few presumptions

Empirical (social science) rests on a few philosophical presumptions \pause 

- We'll call this an **epistemology**: a belief about the nature of knowledge \pause 

Presumptions:

- There is objective truth that exists independently of the observer \pause
- There is order to the world: outcomes of interest are determined by causal forces which we can observe \pause 
- Following a particular method makes us more likely to establish truth \pause 

Learning about empirical methods will allow you to develop your own "epistemology"

## What makes for credible research? 

No clear demarcation between good and bad empirical research \pause

Keep in mind: a single finding/study is scarcely enough \pause

Hallmarks of credible research: \pause

- Clearly defines concepts \pause
- Clearly outlines the assumptions made \pause
- Clearly describes measurement of key concepts \pause
- Considers contradictory evidence and engages in good faith \pause 
- Transparent data collection and analysis
