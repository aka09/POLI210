## Plan for today

- Introducing myself
- What this course is about
- Syllabus and requirements
- Why do you need this course?
- Questions?

## Introducing myself

- M.A. student (3rd year/writing thesis) \pause
- Interests: political behavior, political economy, quantitative methods, metascience \pause 
- Thesis topic: social sorting and affective polarization in Canada \pause 
- Recent work with Profs. Stolle, Gidengil, and Pelc \pause

## Research projects I'm working on

- Does anxiety about coronavirus weaken citizens' commitment to democracy? \pause
- Social sorting/cross-cutting cleavages in Canada \pause
- Decline of local news and attitudes toward trade 

# What is this course about?

## Empirical vs normative 

We have to distinguish between empirical research and normative research \pause

\metroset{block=fill}
\begin{block}{Normative}
  Focuses on: ``shoulds" -- on how things ought to be
  \newline Character: Value-based and prescriptive
  \newline Methods: Persuasion, logic
\end{block}
\pause
\begin{block}{Empirical}
  Focuses on: Measuring and observing how things are 
  \newline Character: Observational, descriptive, predictive
  \newline Methods: Collect evidence from the real world and process   that evidence using the scientific method 
\end{block}

## Empirical vs normative 

POLLING QUESTION HERE: WHICH OF THESE QUESTIONS IS NORMATIVE? 

## Empirical vs normative 

Things are not quite as neat in the real world! \pause

- Normative political science makes use of empirical political science \pause
- And empirical political science often proceeds based on normative assumptions \pause

From the normative statement: "Men and women need equal representation in legislatures"... \pause

1. Does gender equality in legislatures lead to more family-friendly policies?
2. Do quotas mandating a minimum proportion of women in legislatures decrease the quality of legislative output?

## Zooming in on empirical

In empirical political science, we focus on *inferring* things about the political world \pause

- Infer: Form a belief based on a) evidence, and b) rules for processing that evidence \pause

3 types of inference: 

- Descriptive inference: What are the facts? 
- Causal inference: Why does something occur? 
- Predictive inference: How will things shake out? 

## Descriptive inference

## Descriptive inference: DW-NOMINATE scores

## Descriptive inference: UN voting

## Descriptive inference: affective polarization

## Causal inference

Causal inference is about *why* \pause

- Why did Congress polarize? \pause
- Why did the Soviet Union fall? \pause 
- Why did the Arab Spring lead to democracy in Tunisia but not in other countries? 

## Predictive inference 

Prediction is not causation! \pause

Example? What is something I can predict but not interpret causally? 

# Why make me do this? 

## Some reasons 

- The most boring answer: because political scientists use empirical methods and we need to be able to understand! \pause 

  - Just about every area of political science has quantitative components! \pause
  
- Professional advancement \pause 

  - There are *a lot* of jobs for social scientists with skills in empirical analysis \pause
  - Facebook, Twitter, etc. have data science teams composed of many social scientists! \pause 
- Developing a toolbox for your research \pause 
- Engaging with broader scientific debates and controversies \pause 
- Because I need this course for my degree...

## Potentially the most important reason

Because people make empirical claims all the time! \pause

- And people make *bad* empirical claims all the time! \pause
- One of your 1st readings: Gelman

No one in this room can be the ultimate arbiter of empirical truth -- let's not pretend otherwise! \pause

- But claims exist on continuum of plausibility \pause
- Give you tools to assess credibility of claims 

## How are we feeling? 

POLLING QUESTION: FEELING EXCITED/OVERWHELMED/CURIOUS/ANXIOUS

## A note on learning methods 

I know this can be intimidating \pause 

- But this course is *not* math-heavy \pause
- Everyone can do well
- But do try to keep up and use the resources given to you!
- Don't hesitate to reach out

# Syllabus and requirements

## Course components

Lectures: 2x per week (online)

Labs: 1x per week (in person?)

2 quizzes

Midterm + final 

4-5 assignments

## Labs

The labs will introduce you to *R*, a highly-powerful and free programming language

- Main use: manipulating data, performing statistical tests, making graphs and tables... \pause
- But also a lot more: slides, papers, websites, interactive visualizations, scraping... \pause
- Why? \pause
  - Scientifically: replicability and transparency
  - For you: highly marketable and a good tool to master
  
ASAP: Download R and RStudio 

- RStudio: IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
