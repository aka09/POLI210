## The scientific process

0. Familiarize yourself with the literature
1. Identity a problem/puzzle/outcome of interest
2. Come up with a research question
3. Clarify the core concepts
4. Develop a theory
5. Derive hypotheses 
6. Find a suitable way to test hypotheses
7. Gather empirical evidence 
8. Analyze evidence  
9. Communicate the results
\pause

Each of these steps is an art of itself! 
\pause 

Important: this is an endless, iterative process!

- Results refine theory, which leads to more hypotheses, more tests...

## Some vocabulary

**Variable**: A factor that can vary or change (versus a constant) \pause

**Dependent variable** (DV): What we seek to explain \pause

**Independent variable**: Factor that causes some change in the DV \pause

**Hypothesis**: Formal statement of the relationship between DV and IV

**Explanatory theory**: Story that justifies the hypothesis/answers a research question

## 1. Identify a problem/puzzle/outcome

This is what we want to explain -- our **dependent variable** (DV) \pause

We need *variation* in this DV -- otherwise there's nothing to explain!

How do we find our DV? \pause

- Relevance: some things are important to explain! \pause
  - e.g. vaccine hesitancy in current times
  - we want to be able to explain it, predict it, influence it \pause
- A puzzling situation \pause
  - Most people say they favor free trade, yet barriers to trade are immense; why? \pause
- Exploit a deviant case \pause
  - Duverger's Law and Canada's party system


## 2. Come up with a research question

RQ: asks the "who, what, when or why" behind some phenomenon of interest \pause

Example: polarization in Congress \pause

- Has Congress polarized? 
  - Yes, but what is the reference point? \pause
- When did Congress begin to polarize?
  - In the 1980s, roughly \pause
- Who is polarizing -- Democrats or Republicans?
  - Asymmetric polarization: Republicans becoming more extreme at faster rate \pause
- Why has Congress polarized? \pause
  - A polarized electorate? Gerrymandering? Primary elections? Money in politics? \pause
  - Key: most/all political phenomena are **multicausal**

## 2. Research questions (examples)

??

## 3. Clarify the core concepts 

When did the US become a democracy? \pause

We can all agree on:

- When the US gave propertied adult men the right to vote \pause

- When female suffrage was adopted \pause

- When the Voting Rights Act was adopted \pause

But we may disagree on whether these are *necessary* conditions for democracy! \pause

Justice Potter Stewart in *Jacobellis v. Ohio*: "I know it when I see it" re: obscenity \pause

## 4. Develop a theory

Theory: a set of logically related propositions that help explain an outcome. 

- It provides *mechanisms* that explain *how* DV and IV are linked

Say you're interested in the link between attending Harvard and career earnings; potential theories? \pause

- Harvard makes you a more productive/skillful employee \pause
- You make connections at Harvard \pause
- You got into Harvard because you were already better 

These are **observationally equivalent** \pause

- i.e. we may all believe in the link Harvard -> earnings, but diverge on the *why*
- Ideally, each theory has *testable implications*

## 5. Generating hypotheses 

The hypothesis formally states:

- The relationship between two concepts \pause
- The direction of the relationship \pause
- The unit of analysis -- what is one "case" \pause 

## 6. Find a suitable way to test your hypotheses

## 7. Gather empirical evidence

## 8. Analyze evidence

Reflecting back on your theory

- The semantics are important here! \pause
  - Do the results "confirm" the theory? 
  - "Lend support" \pause
  - "are consistent with" \pause
- Generally: make careful statements, consider strength of evidence as a continuum, think about accumulation of evidence \pause 
- Tension: Modifying theory post-hoc

## 9. Communicate the results

How the publication process works: 

Note: this can take a long time! \pause
- Potential problem: social science is often not very responsive to events "on the ground" 

## A note on qualitative vs quantitative approaches

- One is neither more nor less rigorous than the other \pause
- One is neither more or less empirical than the other \pause
- But one may be better suited to a given situation/RQ \pause

Quantitative: large-N, aims for breadth and generalization
Qualitative: small- and medium-N, in-depth look at cases 

People to take sides in this debate... \pause

- I want you to keep an open-mind \pause
- You can have a preference! But we want to be conversant in both \pause

## How a scientist behaves

- Acknowledge uncertainty \pause
- Think probabilistically \pause 
- Convey provisional nature of findings \pause 
  - "Further research should..." \pause
  - Also helps you avoid to do the work yourself if lazy ;)
- Consider alternative explanations \pause
- Acknowledge complexity of multicausal processes \pause

## "Beyond the scope"

## What makes for credible research? 

No clear demarcation between good and bad empirical research \pause

Keep in mind: a single finding/study is scarcely enough \pause

Hallmarks of credible research: \pause

- Clearly defines concepts \pause
- Clearly outlines the assumptions made \pause
- Clearly describes measurement of key concepts \pause
- Considers contradictory evidence and engages in good faith \pause 
- Transparent data collection and analysis 

## Improvements in transparency
