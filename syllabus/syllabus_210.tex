\hypertarget{what-is-this-course-for}{%
\section{What is this course for?}\label{what-is-this-course-for}}

This course is an introduction to research methods in political science.
It will cover a broad range of topics, including questions of philosophy
of science; causality and the difficult enterprise of causal inference;
how to ask empirical questions about the political world (and which ones
to ask!); formulating empirically testable hypotheses; measurement and
data collection using surveys and interviews; and qualitative and
quantitative data analysis techniques designed to test your hypotheses.

\hypertarget{pre-requisites-formal-and-informal}{%
\subsection{Pre-requisites -- formal and
informal}\label{pre-requisites-formal-and-informal}}

Formal: There are no pre-requisites for enrolling in this course.
However, if you have already taken POLI311, you are not eligible to take
this course. For those who matriculated in the fall of 2017 or later,
POLI210 serves as a prerequisite for POLI311.

Informal: You do \emph{not} need to have a math/stats background to
succeed in this course. We will provide you with the tools to succeed
regardless of your background.

\hypertarget{learning-outcomes}{%
\subsection{Learning outcomes}\label{learning-outcomes}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Become critical consumers of political science research and empirical
  claims in popular media.
\item
  Acquire knowledge of important quantitative and qualitative empirical
  methods in the study of politics.
\item
  Become acquainted with \emph{R} -- a free, open-source software that
  is highly marketable (this very syllabus and all course slides were
  created using \emph{R}!)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{textbook-and-other-resources}{%
\section{Textbook and other
resources}\label{textbook-and-other-resources}}

\hypertarget{textbook}{%
\subsection{Textbook}\label{textbook}}

The textbook for this course will be:

Berdahl, Loleen and Keith Archer. \emph{Explorations: Conducting
Empirical Research in Canadian Political Science} (4th edition). Oxford
University Press.

You can purchase the print version at the McGill bookstore or rent a
copy at \href{redshelf.com}{redshelf}. Note that we will be using the
newer 4th edition.

\hypertarget{other-resources}{%
\subsection{Other resources}\label{other-resources}}

People learn in different ways and this is \emph{especially true} when
it comes to research methods. What works for me may not work for you!
Fortunately, there are a lot of resources you can use:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  StackOverflow is a Q\&A forum for programmers. If you type a question
  related to \emph{R} in Google, chances are that a StackOverflow thread
  will show up!
\item
  \emph{Quantitative Social Science: An Introduction} by Kosuke Imai is
  an excellent textbook that can help you learn \emph{R} and principles
  of statistics.
\item
  \emph{The Fundamentals of Political Science Research} by Kellstedt and
  Whitten is a widely-used textbook.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{labs-r-and-rstudio}{%
\section{Labs: R and RStudio}\label{labs-r-and-rstudio}}

In labs, you will be introduced to quantitative data analysis using the
statistical software \emph{R}, a free and open-source program. We will
also be using RStudio, which is a graphical user interface that makes
learning R easier. You can download \emph{R}
\href{http://www.cran.r-project.org}{here}; note that you need to choose
the version that matches your operating system. You can download RStudio
\href{https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/}{here}. Try to
do this as soon as possible! You will need \emph{R} to complete most of
the assignments.

\section{Course and University
policies}\label{course-and-university-policies}}

\hypertarget{lanuage-of-submission}{%
\subsection{Lanuage of submission}\label{lanuage-of-submission}}

In accord with McGill University's Charter of Student Rights, students
in this course have the right to submit in English or in French any
written work that is to be graded. This does not apply to courses in
which acquiring proficiency in a language is one of the objectives.''
(Approved by Senate on 21 January 2009)

\hypertarget{academic-integrity}{%
\subsection{Academic integrity}\label{academic-integrity}}

McGill University values academic integrity. Therefore, all students
must understand the meaning and consequences of cheating, plagiarism and
other academic offences under the Code of
\href{https://www.mcgill.ca/secretariat/files/secretariat/code_of_student_conduct_and_disciplinary_procedures.pdf}{Student
Conduct and Disciplinary Procedures}.

\hypertarget{copyright}{%
\subsection{Copyright}\label{copyright}}

© Instructor-generated course materials (e.g., handouts, notes,
summaries, exam questions) are protected by law and may not be copied or
distributed in any form or in any medium without explicit permission of
the instructor. Note that infringements of copyright can be subject to
follow up by the University under the Code of Student Conduct and
Disciplinary Procedures.

\hypertarget{late-submission}{%
\subsection{Late submission}\label{late-submission}}

Late assignments will be penalized 5 percentage points (out of 100) per
day. Late quizzes will not be accepted. Exceptions apply for illness,
family emergency, or other extraordinary circumstances. You will need to
provide documentation of your predicament and will be given more time to
complete your assignment/quiz.

\hypertarget{re-grading}{%
\subsection{Re-grading}\label{re-grading}}

Students who wish to contest a grade for an assignment or exam must do
so in writing (by email, sent to the instructor) providing the reasoning
behind their challenge to the grade received within two weeks of the day
on which the assignments are returned. The TA who graded the assignment
will re-grade your assignment, and may raise or lower the grade. If you
are still unsatisfied after the re-assessment, you can re-submit the
assignment to me (original copy with TA comments), along with your
justification. I will then re-evaluate the assignment, but also reserve
the right to raise or lower the grade. Please also see
\href{http://www.mcgill.ca/politicalscience/files/politicalscience/assessment_and_\%20re-read_policy_final.pdf}{the
department's guidelines}.

\hypertarget{evaluation-policy}{%
\section{Evaluation policy}\label{evaluation-policy}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Assignments: 45\%. There will be 6 assignments; assignment 1 is worth
  5 points; assignments 2 through 6 are worth 10 points each. You are
  allowed to talk generally about the problem sets with your classmates,
  but you are expected to complete them individually. \emph{You cannot
  share code with your classmates}.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Assignment 1, due on September 20th at 11:59pm, will simply ask to
    fill in a class survey on the platform \emph{Qualtrics}. The data
    you provide here will be of use to create some interactive examples
    in class!
  \item
    Assignment 2, due on October 4th at 11:59pm, will ask you to perform
    basic operations in \emph{R} using the class survey: compute
    measures of central tendency, recoding variables, describing
    distributions.
  \item
    Assignment 3, due on October 25th at 11:59pm, will ask you to work
    with experimental data from a famous political science article. It
    will address issues of causality.
  \item
    Assignment 4, due on November 8th at 11:59pm, will focus on
    analyzing open-ended responses from our class survey as well as the
    case-study approach.
  \item
    Assignment 5, due on November 22nd at 11:59pm, will ask you to work
    with data from the 2019 Canadian Election Study and will focus on
    significance tests, interpreting p-values, and interpreting measures
    of association.
  \item
    Assignment 6, due on December 6th at 11:59pm, will focus on
    multivariate regression.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Midterm: 20\%. The midterm will be held on \textbf{October 19th}.
  Anything covered before then, including in lectures and in the
  readings, is fair game!\\
\item
  Quizzes: 15\%. There will be two quizzes. Again, anything covered in
  lectures or in the readings is fair game.
