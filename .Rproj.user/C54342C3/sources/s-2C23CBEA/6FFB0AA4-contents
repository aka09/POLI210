## Finding a research question

Karl Popper: "there is no such thing as a logical method of having new ideas...Discovery contains an 'irrational element,' or a 'creative intuition.'"

## Problem with scientific literatures

Publication bias: outcome of study influences Pr(publication) \pause

- Most often: "null results" mean no publication \pause
- "file-drawer problem" \pause
- Incentive for researchers: keep looking until you find something! \pause 
- Evidence of this in PS: Gerber et al. [-@gerber_publication_2010]
- Result: 
  - 20 studies find no effect of X on Y
  - 1 study finds effect of X on Y
  - That one study is published, the other 20 are not
- Solutions? 
  - Tolerance of null results \pause
  - Transparency: publish data and code \pause
  - Pre-registration (now obligatory at JoP!) \pause
  - Registered reports (early stages!)
  
## Null results can be interesting!

We often **assume** that there is an effect of X on Y \pause
