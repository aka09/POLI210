## Descriptive case studies 

B&A, p.211: "the phenomenon is either completely or partially unknown...[the goal is] describing the phenomenon as the basis of contributing to an emerging or future research agenda."

## Theory-testing case studies

## Exploratory vs confirmatory 

Gerring [-@gerring_what_2004,p.349]: "Case studies enjoy a natural advantage in research of an exploratory nature." 

## Generalizability and scope conditions

Overgeneralized: "susceptible to being undermined" 
Undergeneralized: "it is susceptible to failing the 'so what' test"

K&A, p.117: "The best approach is to qualify the generalization: the case study is *certain* in its explanation for the phenomenon being studied; it is *highly probably* to have a significant insight on a set of similar cases; and it *suggests* some interesting questions to ask in the widest population of cases." 

## "Failed most-likely" vs "successful least-likely"

## Causal mechanisms 

Gerring [-@gerring_what_2004,p.348]: "Case studies, if well constructed, allow one to peer into the box of causality to the intermediate causes lying between some cause and its purported effect." 

Gerring [-@gerring_what_2004,p.348]: "Ceteris paribus, case studies are more likely to shed light on causal mechanisms and less likely to shed light on true causal effects 

## Qualitative vs quantitative

We've said before that one is not better than the other

They are *complementary*

- Sometimes one approach is best suited to a given RQ \pause
- Other times, we can approach the same RQ from different perspectives \pause
  - Gerring [-@gerring_what_2004] speaks of the "triangulation of evidence"
