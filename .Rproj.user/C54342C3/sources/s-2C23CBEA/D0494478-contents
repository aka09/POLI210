# What is this course for? 

This course is an introduction to research methods in political science. It will cover a broad range of topics, including questions of philosophy of science; causality and the difficult enterprise of causal inference; how to ask empirical questions about the political world (and which ones to ask!); formulating empirically testable hypotheses; measurement and data collection using surveys and interviews; and qualitative and quantitative data analysis techniques designed to test your hypotheses. 

## Pre-requisites -- formal and informal 

Formal: There are no pre-requisites for enrolling in this course. However, if you have already taken POLI311, you are not eligible to take this course. For those who matriculated in the fall of 2017 or later, POLI210 serves as a prerequisite for POLI311.

Informal: You do *not* need to have a math/stats background to succeed in this course. We will provide you with the tools to succeed regardless of your background. 

## Learning outcomes 

- Become critical consumers of political science research and empirical claims in popular media. 
- Acquire knowledge of important quantitative and qualitative empirical methods in the study of politics.
- Become acquainted with *R* -- a free, open-source software that is highly marketable (this very syllabus and all course slides were created using *R*!)

# Textbook and other resources 
## Textbook

The textbook for this course will be: 

Berdahl, Loleen and Keith Archer. *Explorations: Conducting Empirical Research in  Canadian Political Science* (4th edition). Oxford University Press. 

You can purchase the print version at the McGill bookstore or rent a copy at [redshelf](redshelf.com). Note that we will be using the newer 4th edition. 

## Other resources

People learn in different ways and this is *especially true* when it comes to research methods. What works for me may not work for you! Fortunately, there are a lot of resources you can use: 

- StackOverflow is a Q&A forum for programmers. If you type a question related to *R* in Google, chances are that a StackOverflow thread will show up! 
- *Quantitative Social Science: An Introduction* by Kosuke Imai is an excellent textbook that can help you learn *R* and principles of statistics. 
- *The Fundamentals of Political Science Research* by Kellstedt and Whitten is a widely-used textbook.

# Labs: R and RStudio

In labs, you will be introduced to quantitative data analysis using the statistical software *R*, a free and open-source program. We will also be using RStudio, which is a graphical user interface that makes learning R easier. You can download *R* [here](http://www.cran.r-project.org); note that you need to choose the version that matches your operating system. You can download RStudio [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). Try to do this as soon as possible! You will need *R* to complete most of the assignments. 

# Course and University policies

## Lanuage of submission
In accord with McGill University’s Charter of Student Rights, students in this course have the right to submit in English or in French any written work that is to be graded. This does not apply to courses in which acquiring proficiency in a language is one of the objectives.” (Approved by Senate on 21 January 2009) 

## Academic integrity
McGill University values academic integrity. Therefore, all students must understand the meaning and consequences of cheating, plagiarism and other academic offences under the Code of [Student Conduct and Disciplinary Procedures](https://www.mcgill.ca/secretariat/files/secretariat/code_of_student_conduct_and_disciplinary_procedures.pdf).

## Copyright
© Instructor-generated course materials (e.g., handouts, notes, summaries, exam questions) are protected by law and may not be copied or distributed in any form or in any medium without explicit permission of the instructor. Note that infringements of copyright can be subject to follow up by the University under the Code of Student Conduct and Disciplinary Procedures.

## Late submission

Late assignments will be penalized 5 percentage points (out of 100) per day. Late quizzes will not be accepted.  Exceptions apply for illness, family emergency, or other extraordinary circumstances. You will need to provide documentation of your predicament and will be given more time to complete your assignment/quiz.

## Re-grading

Students who wish to contest a grade for an assignment or exam must do so in writing (by email, sent to the instructor) providing the reasoning behind their challenge to the grade received within two weeks of the day on which the assignments are returned. The TA who graded the assignment will re-grade your assignment, and may raise or lower the grade. If you are still unsatisfied after the re-assessment, you can re-submit the assignment to me (original copy with TA comments), along with your justification. I will then re-evaluate the assignment, but also reserve the right to raise or lower the grade. Please also see [the department's guidelines](http://www.mcgill.ca/politicalscience/files/politicalscience/assessment_and_
re-read_policy_final.pdf).

# Evaluation policy 

- Assignments: 45%. There will be 6 assignments; assignment 1 is worth 5 points; assignments 2 through 6 are worth 10 points each. You are allowed to talk generally about the problem sets with your classmates, but you are expected to complete them individually. *You cannot share code with your classmates*.
  - Assignment 1, due on September 20th at 11:59pm, will simply ask to fill in a class survey on the platform *Qualtrics*. The data you provide here will be of use to create some interactive examples in class!
  - Assignment 2, due on October 4th at 11:59pm, will ask you to perform basic operations in *R* using the class survey: compute measures of central tendency, recoding variables, describing distributions. 
  - Assignment 3, due on October 25th at 11:59pm, will ask you to work with experimental data from a famous political science article. It will address issues of causality. 
  - Assignment 4, due on November 8th at 11:59pm, will focus on analyzing open-ended responses from our class survey as well as the case-study approach. 
  - Assignment 5, due on November 22nd at 11:59pm, will ask you to work with data from the 2019 Canadian Election Study and will focus on significance tests, interpreting p-values, and interpreting measures of association.
  - Assignment 6, due on December 6th at 11:59pm, will focus on multivariate regression. 
- Midterm: 20%. The midterm will be held on **October 19th**. Anything covered before then, including in lectures and in the readings, is fair game!  
- Quizzes: 15%. There will be two quizzes. Again, anything covered in lectures or in the readings is fair game.
