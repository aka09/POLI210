## Parsimony 

## Falsifiability

A scientific theory/hypothesis must be *falsifiable*: it must be possible to demonstrate that it is false \pause

- Example? \pause 
- *Riskiness*: it has to "stick its neck out" \pause
- Godfrey-Smith [-@godfrey-smith_theory_2021,p.95]: "theories can appear to have lots of contact with observation when in fact they only have a kind of 'pseudo-contact' with observation, because they avoid all risk."


KKV [-@king_designing_1994,p.19]: "We need to be able to give a direct answer to the question: What evidence would convince us that we are wrong?"



## Is my theory falsifiable?

KKV [-@king_designing_1994,p.19]: "to make sure a theory is falsifiable, choose one that is capable of generating as many *observable implications* as possible."
